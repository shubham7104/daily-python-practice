# 🐍 Python 3 Practice Repository

Welcome to my coding journey! This repository contains a structured list of practice problems and solutions in **Python 3**.

## 🎯 Goals & Consistency
My focus is to master Python concepts through consistent practice:
* **Scope:** Covers everything from **Basic** to **Advanced** topics.
* **Consistency:** Solving **3 questions daily** (approx. 25 questions per week).
* **Progression:** The difficulty level will gradually increase over time.

## 🚀 Future Plans
* Expanding into different **Python Libraries**.
* **Projects:** Larger projects will be published in their own dedicated repositories in the near future.

*Happy Coding!*
